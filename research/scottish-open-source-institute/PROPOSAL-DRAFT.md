# Scottish Open Source Institute — Common Weal Proposal

## Overview
Proposal to Robin McAlpine and the Common Weal for establishing the Scottish Open Source Institute (SOSI).

**Deadline: T-5 days (February 12, 2026)**

## Subject Matter
Complete range of what the institute would do, from now, against a strong timeline of:
1. **Immediate priority**: Protect Scotland's digital sovereignty
2. **Long-term ambition**: Become a world leader in digital sovereignty

## Key Research Documents
- `research/scottish-open-source-institute/information-flow-sovereignty-taxonomy.md` — 173 risk surfaces across 13 dimensions, Scotland's current vulnerability
- `research/scottish-open-source-institute/european-digital-sovereignty-policy-inventory.md` — 180+ initiatives across 30 jurisdictions, policy comparators

## Key People to Meet
- **John** — need to meet very soon (before proposal submission)
- Robin McAlpine — recipient
- Common Weal team — funders/decision-makers

## Core Value Proposition
Scotland currently controls almost none of its 173 identified digital risk surfaces. Small nation comparators (Estonia, Denmark, Norway) demonstrate that populations Scotland's size (~5.5M) can achieve meaningful digital sovereignty through:
- Strategic investment
- Open source adoption
- Federated architecture

## Proposal Structure (Draft)

### 1. The Problem
- Scotland has "service sovereignty without infrastructure sovereignty"
- 173 risk surfaces, minimal direct control
- Examples: SHEFA-2 cable breaks, Microsoft Azure hosting Police Scotland data under US CLOUD Act

### 2. The Opportunity
- Small nation advantage: 5.5M population enables faster decision-making, easier whole-population coverage
- Proven models exist (X-Road, OS2, EMBAG law)
- Devolution provides procurement leverage (primary tool available)

### 3. The Solution — Scottish Open Source Institute
Multi-phase initiative:

**Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)**
- Establish Scottish Digital Sovereignty Observatory
- Map and monitor all 173 risk surfaces
- Create council collaboration framework (OS2-equivalent)
- Initial staffing: Director, 2-3 core staff

**Phase 2: Implementation (Months 6-18)**
- Deploy pilot projects in health/education
- Build Scottish Government Cloud Platform
- Establish Nordic partnerships
- Scale to 8-12 staff

**Phase 3: Leadership (Months 18-36)**
- Advocate for EMBAG-equivalent legislation
- Develop sub-national sovereignty framework (academic)
- Position Scotland as world leader
- Full operational team: 15-20 staff

### 4. Costings (Needs Detail)
Rough estimates based on comparators:
- **Year 1**: £XXXk (foundation, 3-4 FTE)
- **Year 2**: £XXXk (pilot projects, 8-10 FTE)
- **Year 3**: £XXXk (scale, 15-20 FTE)

Need to research:
- Wales CDPS budget (£X million?)
- Denmark OS2 funding model
- Estonia X-Road costs

### 5. Timeline
- **Immediate** (T-5 to T+30): Proposal → Meetings → Refinement
- **Month 1**: Funding secured, institute legally established
- **Month 3**: Observatory operational, initial hires
- **Month 6**: Pilot projects launched
- **Month 12**: First deliverables, mid-year review
- **Month 24**: Full operations, demonstrable impact
- **Month 36**: World leadership positioning

## Open Questions
- Exact budget figures needed
- Legal structure (charity? CIC? arm's-length body?)
- Relationship to Scottish Government (funding vs independence)
- Physical location
- John's role/contribution

## Next Actions
1. Meet with John — clarify his involvement, expertise contribution
2. Research comparable budgets (Wales CDPS, Nordic institutes)
3. Draft executive summary (1-2 pages)
4. Build detailed budget
5. Create visual timeline/roadmap
6. Review with Christopher
7. Submit to Robin McAlpine

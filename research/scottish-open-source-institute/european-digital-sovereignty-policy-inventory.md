# European Digital Sovereignty: A Comprehensive Policy Inventory for Scotland

Europe's digital sovereignty movement accelerated dramatically between 2022 and 2025, driven by geopolitical tensions, US CLOUD Act concerns, and the weaponization of technology infrastructure. **Germany's Schleswig-Holstein is migrating 30,000 PCs to Linux/LibreOffice, Denmark announced its Microsoft exit in June 2025, and Switzerland enacted the world's strongest "public money, public code" law in January 2024.** This inventory maps 180+ initiatives across 30 jurisdictions to inform Scottish digital policy development.

The landscape divides into two strategic tracks: **defensive sovereignty** (reducing dependency on US hyperscalers) and **generative sovereignty** (building indigenous digital capability). Most advanced nations pursue both simultaneously. France leads in sovereign cloud certification, Germany in open source workplace alternatives, the Nordics in cross-border data exchange, and Italy in mandatory code publication. Scotland's comparators—Wales and Ireland—show meaningful digital strategies but limited sovereignty-specific policies, creating opportunity for Scottish leadership.

## EU-level frameworks establish the regulatory foundation

The European Commission built comprehensive legal infrastructure for digital sovereignty between 2022 and 2024, now entering implementation phase across member states.

### Core Legislative Framework (All Operational)

| Legislation | Status | Key Sovereignty Provision |
|------------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Data Governance Act** | Operational since Sept 2023 | Establishes trusted mechanisms for data sharing; supports Common European Data Spaces |
| **Data Act** | Core provisions Sept 2025 | Safeguards against third-country government access to EU-held non-personal data |
| **Interoperable Europe Act** | Operational since July 2024 | Mandates interoperability assessments; prioritizes open source; €5B annual savings expected |
| **EUCS Cloud Certification** | Draft stage (March 2024) | Three assurance levels; sovereignty requirements removed but member states may impose national requirements |

The **European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles**, signed December 2022 by all 27 member states, established the political framework: human-centric digital transformation with citizens at the centre. The Commission now monitors implementation through annual "State of the Digital Decade" reports.

### Gaia-X: Europe's Federated Data Infrastructure

Gaia-X entered its implementation phase in 2025 after contentious early years. The Franco-German initiative now operates **10 accredited Digital Clearing Houses** across France, Spain, Italy, and Germany, with **180+ data spaces** in development. Key operational projects include Structura-X (Dutch reference implementation using only European providers) and DataMarketPlace.NRW (state-wide IoT data space for North Rhine-Westphalia).

Criticism persists regarding hyperscaler membership. Scaleway departed in November 2021, citing concerns that Microsoft, Google, and AWS participation undermined the initiative's sovereignty purpose. The **November 2024 Helsinki Summit** drew 600+ participants from 40+ countries, signaling continued momentum despite these tensions.

### European Open Source Infrastructure

The **European Commission OSPO**, established in 2020 within DG Digital Services, operates code.europa.eu with **214 main projects and 737 repositories**. The **EU OSPO Network**, launched May 2022, now includes approximately 13 organizations from 8 member states—city administrations, ministries, and research organizations sharing open source practices.

The **Open Source Observatory (OSOR)**, celebrating its 15th anniversary in 2023, provides the knowledge backbone. Its 2023 awards recognized Decidim (Barcelona's participation platform), France's BlueHats community, and Denmark's OS2 as exemplars. OSOR's new eLearning course on open source for public administrations launched in 2024.

## Germany leads Europe's open source transformation

Germany emerged as Europe's most ambitious implementer of digital sovereignty policy, operating parallel tracks: pure open source alternatives and "sovereign hyperscaler" partnerships.

### Federal Open Source Infrastructure (All Operational)

| Initiative | Launch | Status | Scale |
|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| **ZenDiS** (Center for Digital Sovereignty) | Dec 2022 | Operational | Coordinates federal open source strategy |
| **openCode Platform** | May 2022 | Operational | 3,000+ open source solutions catalogued |
| **openDesk Workplace Suite** | Oct 2024 (v1.0) | Operational | 70,000+ enterprise licenses deployed |
| **Deutsche Verwaltungscloud** | April 2025 | Operational | 40+ cloud services from 10+ providers |
| **OZG 2.0 Open Source Priority** | June 2024 | In force | Federal agencies must prefer open source |

**openDesk** represents Germany's flagship achievement—a complete open source office suite combining Univention Corporate Server, Collabora Online, Nextcloud, OpenProject, XWiki, Jitsi, and Matrix/Element. Already adopted by the Federal Ministry of Health, FITKO, the State of Berlin, the Swiss Federal Administration, and notably the **International Criminal Court in November 2025**.

The **OZG 2.0 law** (effective June 2024) amended Germany's E-Government Act to mandate open source preference in federal procurement, implementing the coalition agreement's "Public Money, Public Code" principle. Development contracts must now be commissioned as open source by default.

### Schleswig-Holstein: Europe's Model Migration

The northern German state represents the most comprehensive Linux migration currently underway. The April 2024 cabinet decision initiated migration of **30,000 PCs from Windows/Office to Linux/LibreOffice**, with **80% completion outside tax administration** by early 2025.

**Financial projections**: €15 million annual license cost savings from 2026, requiring one-time €9 million investment. The six-pillar migration strategy covers: Microsoft Office to LibreOffice, Windows to Linux (likely KDE Plasma), SharePoint/Exchange/Outlook to Nextcloud/Open-Xchange/Thunderbird, Active Directory to open source directory services, specialized application compatibility assessment, and telephone system migration.

Minister-President Daniel Günther's government published the **"Deutschland-Stack" vision paper** in July 2025, aligned with the European EuroStack initiative. Schleswig-Holstein won the **Nextcloud Digital Sovereignty Award 2025** (Implementation Category).

### Other German States and Municipalities

**Thuringia** pioneered open source requirements through its 2018 E-Government Act, mandating open source priority where technically possible and economical. In March 2024, the state deployed **OpenTalk video conferencing** ("ThMeet") statewide—the first solution to receive a BSI IT Security Label for video conferencing.

**Munich** reversed its famous LiMux return-to-Microsoft decision. The May 2020 Green-SPD coalition agreement committed to "Public Money, Public Code," and the city established an **OSPO in October 2024** headed by Kubernetes pioneer Klaus Mueller. Current initiatives include MUCGPT (LLM web interface) and contributions to upstream projects. Munich maintains **169 repositories** on GitHub but is **not returning to Linux desktops**—instead focusing on server-side open source and developer community engagement.

**Dortmund** established a **Coordination Office for Digital Sovereignty and Open Source** in January 2023, working with KGSt on reproducible open source governance models. **Berlin's** November 2021 coalition agreement mandates seeking open source alternatives in every procurement.

### Sovereign Hyperscaler Partnerships

Germany simultaneously pursues "sovereign hyperscaler" arrangements. **Delos Cloud** (SAP/Microsoft/Arvato joint venture) announced October 2024 contracts, with Azure services expected H1 2025 and Microsoft 365 H2 2025. SAP invested €2 billion in sovereign cloud infrastructure; Chancellor Scholz personally promoted the initiative to state premiers. A Franco-German alliance with France's Bleu provides crisis resilience.

## France built Europe's most rigorous cloud certification

France's **SecNumCloud** certification (version 3.2) established nearly **1,200 requirements** covering cybersecurity, legal, and operational dimensions. Critically, it mandates **immunity from extraterritorial laws** (CLOUD Act, FISA, Patriot Act) and requires European capital ownership with French/EU data localization.

### Sovereign Cloud Providers (All Operational or Imminent)

| Provider | Ownership | SecNumCloud Status | Key Details |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| **S3NS** (Thales/Google) | 61% French | Qualified Dec 2025 | 60+ customers; 3 French data centers |
| **Bleu** (Orange/Capgemini/Microsoft) | 100% French | Pursuing qualification | Commercial launch Jan 2024 |
| **OVHcloud** | French | Multiple qualifications | 80+ customers on SecNumCloud Private Cloud |

The **Cloud au Centre** doctrine (July 2021 Circular 6282-SG) made SecNumCloud mandatory for sensitive government data, reinforced by the **SREN Law (May 2024, Article 31)**. EDF selected S3NS/Bleu for strategic cloud in 2024-2025.

### French Open Source Leadership

**DINUM's Pôle Open Source** (renamed September 2024) maintains **SILL**—the Interministerial Catalog of Recommended Free Software—which grew from **32 packages in 2013 to 500 by end of 2024**. The catalog, co-constructed with interministerial working groups, covers office suites, servers, databases, development tools, and CMS platforms.

France's government explicitly **banned free Microsoft Office 365 and Google Workspace in schools** (October 2021 guidance, confirmed November 2022) citing GDPR concerns and procurement requirements. Deployed alternatives include Moodle (Éléa), Nextcloud, BigBlueButton, and La Forge (government GitLab).

**Tchap**, the government's secure instant messaging based on Matrix protocol, serves ministries for internal communications. The **Gendarmerie Nationale's GendBuntu**—a custom Ubuntu distribution—runs on **70,000+ workstations** since 2008, demonstrating long-term open source viability.

### Digital Identity Infrastructure

**FranceConnect** reached **40+ million users** by 2024, providing single sign-on to 1,400+ online services. **France Identité**, designated as France's EU Digital Identity Wallet, created **3.2 million digital IDs with 525,000 fully certified** through town hall verification. Target: 5 million users by end 2026.

## Nordic nations demonstrate divergent approaches

The Nordic region shows striking variation in digital sovereignty strategy, from Denmark's aggressive Microsoft exit to Finland's pragmatic hyperscaler adoption.

### Denmark: Active Microsoft Phase-Out

Denmark's **Ministry of Digitalisation announced Microsoft Office 365 phase-out in June 2025**, transitioning to LibreOffice and Linux. Approximately half of Ministry employees migrated by summer 2025, with full completion by autumn. Copenhagen and Aarhus municipalities announced similar plans shortly before.

Minister Caroline Stage Olsen cited Microsoft's temporary email restrictions on the ICC as evidence of vulnerability. The **Joint Government Digital Strategy 2026-2029** makes digital sovereignty a priority for the first time—clarifying this is "not about isolation or digital nationalism" but avoiding over-dependency.

**OS2**, the Danish public sector open source community founded 2012, represents perhaps Europe's most successful municipal collaboration: **82 members covering 84% of Denmark's 98 municipalities**. The community manages 25 open source codebases including OS2kitos (IT portfolio management, used by 75 municipalities), OS2borgerPC (citizen terminals), and OS2Web (Drupal-based municipal CMS).

**MitID**, Denmark's third-generation digital identity, replaced NemID fully in November 2023, achieving **98% population adoption**. Co-owned by state (40%), regions (40%), and municipalities (20%).

### Sweden: Cautious Cloud Policy Development

Sweden's **DIGG** (Agency for Digital Government) coordinates public administration digitalization. A new **cloud policy is in development** to guide public sector use while addressing CLOUD Act concerns—the **eSam Programme** explicitly identified US law incompatibility with Swedish data protection.

**Sambruk**, the municipal collaboration network, includes **110+ of Sweden's 290 municipalities**, supporting open source projects like Bibblix (children's digital library app), EGIL (student account management), and the Tjänstekatalog project (GDPR compliance assessment for digital learning resources).

### Finland: Cloud-First Pragmatism

Finland adopted a **cloud-first strategy**, with **73% of public agencies on cloud** (except sensitive sectors). The State Treasury pioneered Nordic public sector multicloud using Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

**City of Helsinki** leads open source innovation with the **Helsinki Design System** (accessibility-audited React/HTML components), a **€1 million digital twin project**, and the **Personal Data Framework** developed with the World Economic Forum.

### Norway: Azure Partnership with Open Source Elements

**Digdir** (established January 2020) operates Norway's digital infrastructure including **Altinn**, the digital platform for government-citizen-business dialogue. **Altinn 3 runs on Microsoft Azure in Norwegian data centers**, following comprehensive Data Protection Impact Assessment. The platform itself is **being rebuilt as open source** and designated a Digital Public Good.

The **National Digitalisation Strategy 2024-2030** targets making Norway the "world's most digitalised country by 2030" with 1 Gbit/s broadband for everyone.

### Cross-Nordic Cooperation

The **Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions (NIIS)**, established 2017 by Estonia and Finland, manages **X-Road**—the world's first federated cross-border data exchange, operational since February 2018. Iceland joined as member; Ukraine, Faroe Islands, and Åland participate as partners.

The **Nordic-Baltic Cooperation Programme for Digitalisation 2025-2030** (approved September 2024) prioritizes harmonizing EU regulation implementation, promoting interoperability, and ethical AI development. The **Nordic-Baltic Declaration on European Digital Identity Wallets** commits to a common certification scheme by end 2026.

## Southern and Eastern Europe show varied maturity

### Italy: Mandatory Code Publication

Italy's **Codice dell'Amministrazione Digitale (Article 69)** legally requires public administrations to **publish commissioned software under open license**. This makes Italy home to Europe's strongest software reuse mandate.

**Developers Italia** catalogs public sector open source, using **publiccode.yml**—a metadata standard of Italian origin now adopted EU-wide for the Open Source Solutions Catalogue (2025). The standard is mandatory for all public software in Italy since 2020.

The **Polo Strategico Nazionale (PSN)** provides sovereign cloud infrastructure through a consortium of TIM (45%), Leonardo (25%), CDP (20%), and Sogei (10%). Four green data centers serve public administration with **target of 75% of Italian PAs using cloud by 2026**. PNRR funding: €900+ million for cloud migration.

### Spain and Barcelona

Spain's **Technology Transfer Centre** hosts **338+ projects** enabling software reuse across public administrations under Law 40/2015. However, Spain lacks an explicit national "public money, public code" policy.

**Barcelona** demonstrates municipal digital sovereignty leadership. The **Digital City initiative** (2015-present) includes systematic transition to open source and **Decidim**—the participatory democracy platform now used by 30+ countries including the EU Commission, engaging **8.5+ million citizens**. Barcelona signed the **UN Open Source Principles in November 2025**, the first city worldwide.

The **DECODE project** (2017-2019, €5 million Horizon 2020) pioneered data sovereignty through blockchain and cryptography, producing tools like Zenroom (cryptographic smart contracts) now maintained as open source.

### Portugal and Greece

Portugal's **MOSAICO framework** explicitly states "Make new code open source" as a principle, with **Decree-Law 107/2012** requiring OSS preference for ICT projects over €10,000. The **Autenticação.gov middleware** (Citizen Card and Mobile Digital Key) is built on open source components and published on GitHub.

Greece's **gov.gr platform** grew from **503 services in 2020 to 1,820+ services in 2024**, serving 8.5 million citizens. The **Digital Transformation Bible 2020-2025** guides €6.4 billion EU Recovery Fund investment. However, Greece lacks explicit open source mandates, focusing instead on open data through data.gov.gr.

### Central Europe Highlights

**Switzerland** enacted the **world's strongest "Public Money Public Code" law** (EMBAG, effective January 1, 2024) after 12 years of debate. Article 9 makes mandatory the publication of source code for software developed by/for federal agencies unless third-party rights or security prevent it.

**Austria's Bundesheer** (Armed Forces) completed migration of **16,000 desktop workstations from Microsoft Office to LibreOffice** by September 2025, saving approximately **$6.5 million annually**. The **Federal Ministry for Economy** deployed Nextcloud for 1,200 employees, replacing US cloud providers after legal risk assessment.

**Estonia** remains the global exemplar of digital government—achieving **100% service digitalization in December 2024** and ranking 2nd on the UN E-Government Development Index. **X-Road** handles 50+ million queries monthly across 450+ organizations. The **Data Embassy** concept (server infrastructure in Luxembourg with Estonian jurisdiction) provides digital continuity insurance.

**Poland's Chmura Krajowa** (National Cloud Operator, founded 2018) pursues hybrid strategy: proprietary domestic platform plus Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure resale. Google invested in Warsaw region; Microsoft committed $1 billion including new datacenter.

## UK devolved administrations offer comparison

Wales and Northern Ireland operate within UK Government Digital Service frameworks, offering relevant comparisons for Scottish policy development.

### Wales

The **Centre for Digital Public Services (CDPS)**, established 2020, implements the Digital Strategy for Wales with a strong "convening" role across the public sector. **Digital Health and Care Wales** explicitly commits that "wherever feasible we will adopt open-source building blocks and cloud-based technologies," using Apache Solr for clinical document indexing across 32 nodes with 20+ million documents.

Wales maintains **statutory Welsh language requirements** for all digital services under the Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011—creating de facto digital sovereignty through language. Scotland lacks equivalent statutory requirements for Gaelic.

### Northern Ireland

The **HSC Digital Strategy 2022-2030** guides health digitalization, with the **Encompass Programme** achieving full Epic EMR deployment across all Health Trusts by 2025-2026—a unified platform approach Scotland might consider.

Northern Ireland faces unique cross-border complexity: UK GDPR applies in NI while EU GDPR governs the Republic, creating potential "data borders." No formal all-Ireland digital cooperation framework exists despite geographic proximity.

### Ireland

**Harnessing Digital: The Digital Ireland Framework** (2022, 2025 update pending) aligns with EU Digital Decade. **MyGovID** reached **2.3 million verified accounts** by October 2023 with EU Digital Wallet compatibility—more advanced than Scottish equivalents.

Ireland's position as EU data hub (Dublin ranks 3rd largest European data center market at 738MW, hosting EU headquarters for Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta) demonstrates the economic implications of digital infrastructure sovereignty decisions. The **Data Protection Commission** serves as lead GDPR supervisory authority for major global tech, demonstrating regulatory sovereignty within EU frameworks.

Ireland lacks formal open source policy but is exploring OSPO establishment. The EU OSS Country Intelligence Report (2024) notes "limited direct mentions of open source in OGCIO's work."

## Cross-border initiatives enable collaboration

### European Digital Infrastructure Consortium for Digital Commons

Established **July 2025** with Germany, France, Italy, and Netherlands, this consortium jointly develops and scales sovereign digital tools like openDesk. The initiative followed Schleswig-Holstein's migration and the ICC's Microsoft replacement.

### Three Seas Initiative

This 13-member Central European framework (including Poland, Czech Republic, Austria, and Baltic states) identified **€160 billion digital infrastructure investment need by 2030**. The **3SI Digital Highway** prioritizes fiber optic connectivity across the region. The 3SI Investment Fund holds approximately €900 million in assets targeting €3-5 billion.

### Foundation for Public Code

Based in the Netherlands, this non-profit supports public sector code collaboration through the **Standard for Public Code**. In February 2024, it acknowledged membership model challenges and pivoted toward a global umbrella organization with local chapters. First member: Provincie Zuid-Holland.

## Patterns and implications for Scotland

European digital sovereignty activity clusters around four strategic approaches:

**Regulatory sovereignty** through certification and standards (France's SecNumCloud, Italy's publiccode.yml mandate, Switzerland's EMBAG law) creates legally enforceable requirements that shape market behavior.

**Operational sovereignty** through migration (Schleswig-Holstein, Denmark, Austrian Bundesheer) demonstrates practical independence from proprietary dependencies, with documented cost savings and risk reduction.

**Collaborative sovereignty** through shared infrastructure (X-Road, OS2, openDesk, Gaia-X) pools resources across jurisdictions, reducing individual development costs while maintaining collective independence.

**Regulatory positioning** through EU alignment (Ireland's DPC role, European Digital Identity Wallet participation) leverages supranational frameworks for national advantage.

Scotland operates within UK frameworks that lack explicit digital sovereignty policies. However, devolution provides latitude for distinctive approaches—as Wales demonstrates through statutory language requirements and NHS digital strategy. The European inventory reveals that **meaningful digital sovereignty typically requires 5-10 year commitment horizons**, legal mandates rather than voluntary guidelines, and cross-border collaboration to achieve scale.

The most successful initiatives combine defensive measures (reducing hyperscaler dependency) with generative investments (building indigenous capability). Germany's simultaneous pursuit of openDesk and Delos Cloud exemplifies this dual-track approach—maintaining negotiating leverage while developing alternatives.

For Scotland, the inventory suggests opportunities in healthcare data sovereignty (building on NHS Scotland's existing systems), education platform alternatives (following French and German models), municipal collaboration (adapting OS2 or Sambruk approaches), and participation in emerging European frameworks (EDIC for Digital Commons, Nordic-Baltic cooperation). Wales's CDPS model offers a proven devolved-nation approach to digital strategy coordination.

## Conclusion

Europe's digital sovereignty landscape transformed between 2022 and 2025 from policy aspiration to operational reality. Switzerland legislated mandatory code publication; Germany deployed 70,000+ licenses of its sovereign workplace suite; Denmark announced Microsoft phase-out; Italy mandated open source preference in law. These represent **mature, replicable models** rather than experimental pilots.

The inventory reveals that digital sovereignty requires sustained political commitment, dedicated institutional capacity (OSPOs, digital agencies, certification bodies), legal mandates with enforcement mechanisms, and cross-border collaboration for scale. Nations achieving meaningful sovereignty pursued both defensive and generative strategies simultaneously.

Scotland faces a choice: continue within UK frameworks that show limited sovereignty ambition, or leverage devolution to establish distinctive digital independence. The European evidence suggests the latter path requires decade-scale commitment—but offers substantial returns in cost savings, security, democratic accountability, and technological capability. The infrastructure exists; the question is political will.
